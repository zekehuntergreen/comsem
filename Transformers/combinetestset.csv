"We have college, too.",,,1
I live like Spokane.,,,1
The people who live in small town have good relationship each other.,,,1

And give other person wrong information.,,,1

The other man thought he is girl.,,,1
I think many students do that things.,,,1
"He was in this room, and he was in other room.",,,1
"The king's chef made a very taste dish, which was made by vegetables and eggs and some butter.",,,1
Hodja friends got shocked.,,,1
A stranger man came to Hodja.,,,1
